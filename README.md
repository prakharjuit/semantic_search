Semantic-search-bar-
Overview
This project is a semantic search system designed to enhance the search functionality of an Android-based e-commerce application. The system uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand and process user queries, providing more accurate and relevant search results. This improves the user experience and helps increase the company's revenue.

Features
Semantic Search: Utilizes SpaCy to understand user intent and provide relevant product search results.
Real-Time Autocomplete: Implements AJAX-based real-time search suggestions as the user types.
Efficient Data Processing: Uses Pandas to filter and process large datasets stored in CSV format.
Responsive Front-End: Built with jQuery and jQuery UI to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience.
RESTful API: Flask-based backend that handles search queries and integrates seamlessly with the Android e-commerce app.
Technologies Used
Backend: Flask, Pandas
NLP: SpaCy
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, jQuery UI
Data Handling: CSV
Version Control: Git
Usage Search Products: Type in the search bar to get real-time product suggestions. Explore Data: The application filters through a CSV dataset containing product information to return the most relevant results.

Challenges and Solutions Handling Large Datasets: Optimized the data filtering process using Pandas to ensure quick response times even with large product datasets. Real-Time Search: Integrated AJAX for asynchronous data fetching, providing users with instant search suggestions without reloading the page.

Future Enhancements Database Integration: Replace CSV with a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL for better scalability. Advanced Filtering: Implement additional filters for more refined search results (e.g., price range, categories). User Interface: Further enhance the UI for mobile responsiveness and improved user interaction.
